Selected Quantarhei classes have the capability to saved them selves to disk or be loaded from the disk. Each object can save itself, and it can be loaded either by an empty object of its class or by the Quantarhei Manager.

The format of the objects is based on ``numpy.savez`` and ``numpy.load`` functions.
